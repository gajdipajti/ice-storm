ice-storm
=========

Anisotropy calculation on pictures
anisotropy.m  -> a dead end, and it was dropped. But still remains in the package for the data reading.
ice_dev.m     -> the current development branch. Still in no shape to generate results.
iceCenter.m   -> Using the map data from the pre-processor, it processes the interesting Z-Stacks (R) from real picture data.
iceGaussian.m -> Background substraction and volume calculation under the 2D Gaussian surface. Currently only "Riemann mode".
